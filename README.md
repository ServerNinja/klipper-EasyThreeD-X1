# klipper-EasyThreeD-X1

This is a klipper configuration I made for the EasyThreeD X1 printer. No physical modifications have been made to the printer as the initial goal for this project is to get Klipper working with a stock hardware configuration for this printer.

Currently I do not have the heated bed.

## My personal goals with this printer:

At first, I want to figure out a working configuration for this printer without making any physical modifications to the actual printer. At some point, I may decide to do some upgrades to this printer (new stepper motors, hot end, extruder, heated bed, etc.) but that will all depend on how much time I have to devote to this project and if I feel its worth my time doing so. Hopefully you may find this helpful in your journey with this printer.
